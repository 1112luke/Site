The cobalt 2 color scheme!!! #FFC600 #0E3A59 #1F4662 #162F43 I initially came across this scheme about 4 years ago when I decided to change my VS code theme from the default. After trying a few options, I fount Cobalt 2, and since then it has been my goto theme for anything that I need to style. I would say one of my weakest traits in general is style. I have no sense for colors, so having a default for everything is phenomenal. On top of this, it is satisfying when all of the tools I frequently use on my computer have the same colors. Everything becomes very cohesive, and my machine becomes uniquely mine. Maybe someday I'll get tired of the scheme, but for the time being, I plan to keep styling all my tools this way. Back to Top Â© 2025 Luke Scholler About All Posts Projects This Website is a Work in Progress!! Chat With (AI) Me Luke Schollerhaha About All Posts Projects The Story of This Website Published March 21, 2025 History This website has been in the works for almost a year, yet I built this version up to this point in less than a month... Let me explain. This is the third iteration of my website. The first was made during my senior year of high school, and was pure HTML and CSS. After a bit, I became emberassed having that site up with my name on it, and knew it needed a refresh. I had learned React for some miscellaneous projects, and was ready to begin building. I wanted my site to be impressive, so I set out with an ambitious plan: make the website fully 3D. Any 2D elements would be pasted onto 2D planes in the space I would build out, and the scroll experience would have the user flying through a starfield of all of my projects and posts. It was going to be glorious... or so I thought. After working on and off for about a month and a half, I had the following prototype: If you mess with the above website a bit, you will probably notice three things: it is cool it bears strong resemblance to the current website it is hard to navigate, buggy, confusing, bulky, and unintuitive At a certain point, I finally decided to scrap the project, and I was so upset. The reality is, it was so cool. My work on this project for a long time was heavily motivated by the sunk-cost fallacy. I did end up cutting my losses though, as the codebase became very hard to work with and reviews from friends expressed the sentiment that yes, it was cool, but no, it was not enjoyable or intuitive to use. Looking back, the website was more of a lesson in project planning than in software. While I did learn a lot about web development, the most valuable thing I learned was about the value of design for functionality first, only implementing cool features where strong underlying design principles have already been established. When I began work on this website a little less than a month ago, progress came quickly. My react skills were honed, but, more importantly, I was equipped with the wisdom that can only come from a failure like the previous one that design and UI would come first. The Tools I Use In no particular order, the main tools I use to create this website are: React Three.js (react-three-fiber) Motion (previously Framer Motion) Netlify As you can see, the stack is relatively simple. I hear many things about Next.js for server side rendeering or Tailwind for CSS, but in my experience I have never felt limited by pure react and standard CSS. While my website might not be the fastest or the most pretty looking, I enjoy being relatively close to the actual HTML that my webpage will display and like the challenge of styling all of my components using vanilla CSS. Now, lets break down the tools I use one by one. I'll be using this card element I created for the following explanations: Example April 3, 2025 Ullamco culpa non occaecat cupidatat reprehenderit esse amet ex exercitation commodo pariatur consequat dolor et magna. In do anim id duis in labore ad irure dolor adipisicing consectetur veniam aute anim proident. Eu in cillum quis. #example1#example2 rendered using the following code: <Card title=Example id=ex date={dateToWords(new Date())} description=Ullamco culpa non occaecat cupidatat reprehenderit esse amet ex exercitation commodo pariatur consequat dolor et magna. In do anim id duis in labore ad irure dolor adipisicing consectetur veniam aute anim proident. Eu in cillum quis. tags={[example1, example2]} blank={true} index={1} /> React Of all the programmatic paradigmns, I find compartmentalization and reuseability to be the most satisfying. Computers are really really good at doing the same thing over and over again. When I am able to design a component in React and have it map to a wide array of data, I feel powerful, like I am taking advantage of the computer. As you can see above, Creating the card is easy with the custom react component that I made. The short lines of code above really translate to the following: <> <Link> <motion.div id=container whileHover={{ backgroundColor: #325671, boxShadow: -5px 5px #285071, scale: 1.01, rotate: index % 2 ? 0.5 : -0.5, }} transition={{ type: tween, duration: 0.2 }} > <h2>{title}</h2> <h4>{date}</h4> <p >{description}</p> <div id=tagbox> {tags.map((tag, index) => { return ( <div key={index} > tag </div> ); })} </div> </motion.div> </Link> </> This is a lot of code encapsulated by a simple component in react! It gets better though. To create a list of the card elements, each with different data, we can use a javascript map function to spawn many cards based on an array of data. Here is how that works: const posts = [ { id: I've-Discovered-Docker, public: true, title: I've Discovered Docker And My Life Will Never Be The Same, description: lorem.generateSentences(3), date: new Date(2025-02-23), tags: [blog], component: <Post1></Post1>, }, { id: Post-2, public: false, title: The Useless Box: Do you Remember These?, description: lorem.generateSentences(3), date: new Date(2025-02-23), tags: [blog, project], component: <Post2></Post2>, }, { id: Post-3, public: false, title: How I created a Linkedin AI bot that talked to my friend for three hours, description: lorem.generateSentences(3), date: new Date(2025-02-24), tags: [blog, project], component: <Post2></Post2>, }, { id: Post-4, public: false, title: Cobalt Blue EVERYTHING, description: lorem.generateSentences(3), date: new Date(2025-02-26), tags: [blog], component: <Post2></Post2>, }, { id: this-website, public: true, title: The Story of This Website, description: lorem.generateSentences(3), date: new Date(2025-03-21), tags: [blog, project], component: <Post5></Post5>, }, { id: Post-6, public: false, title: Sorting algorithms, rust, and web assembly, description: lorem.generateSentences(3), date: new Date(2025-02-27), tags: [blog, project], component: <Post2></Post2>, }, { id: thinking-in-code, public: false, title: Thinking in Code, description: lorem.generateSentences(3), date: new Date(2025-02-26), tags: [blog, project], component: <Post7></Post7>, }, { id: pid-control, public: true, title: An Exploration of PID Control, description: lorem.generateSentences(3), date: new Date(2025-03-17), tags: [blog, project], component: <Post8></Post8>, }, { id: smells-like-calculus, public: true, title: A Calculus Parody Music Video, description: lorem.generateSentences(3), date: new Date(2025-03-20), tags: [blog, project], component: <Post9></Post9>, }, ]; {posts.map((post, index) => post.public ? ( <div key={post.id}> <Card title={post.title} id={post.id} date={dateToWords(post.date)} description={post.description} tags={post.tags} index={index} /> <br /> </div> ) : null )} The above contains an array of json objects, each representing a post on my webpage. We can then use posts.map on the data to display a card for each element on the array. AMAZING! Framer Motion I use framer motion for most of the animation on this site. Examples include the underline bars in my header, the hover effect on the card above, or even the mouse tracking feature of the cube on the front page of this website. I could explain it, but their website is just too good that I'm going to direct you there if you want to learn more. Three.js For all the 3D components on this website, I am using Three.js, specifically react-three-fiber, an implementation of three for react. See below the background I made for some pages on this website website: If you look closely, you see that the cubes are rotating randomly. You might also notice that the cubes are different with each refresh of this page. The code for this component is shown below: import React, { useEffect, useState } from react; import { Canvas } from @react-three/fiber; import { OrbitControls } from @react-three/drei; import Cube from ./Cube; const ThreeBackground = ({ abs = false }) => { const num_cubes = 30; var [cubes, setcubes] = useState([]); //generate starting point for unique cubes useEffect(() => { var tempcubes = []; var xextent = 160; var yextent = 120; var zextent = 160; for (var i = 0; i < num_cubes; i++) { tempcubes.push({ x: Math.floor(Math.random() * xextent) - xextent / 2, y: Math.floor(Math.random() * yextent) - yextent / 2, z: Math.floor(Math.random() * zextent) - zextent / 2 - 80, rot: { x: Math.floor(Math.random() * 360), y: Math.floor(Math.random() * 360), z: Math.floor(Math.random() * 360), }, }); } setcubes(tempcubes); }, []); return ( <Canvas gl={{ pixelRatio: 20, }} style={{ position: abs ? absolute : fixed, top: 0, left: 0, width: abs ? 100% : 100vw, height: abs ? 100% : 100vh, zIndex: -1, }} > <ambientLight intensity={1} /> <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} /> {cubes.map((cube, index) => { return ( <Cube x={cube.x} y={cube.y} z={cube.z} rot={cube.rot} key={index} ></Cube> ); })} </Canvas> ); }; export default ThreeBackground; This component can be broken down into two main parts, the data structure for each cube and the rendering of the cubes. Let's start with the data structure. All of the logic for creating the cubes data structure happens within a useEffect react hook with no dependencies so that it only runs when the component is mounted. I have some variables to setup the extent of the bounds for my scene to render all of the cubes within. Then, in a loop, I create a set of random cubes as objects with attributes for their rotation and position. To render the cubes, I am using some basic react-three-fiber components. I start with a Canvas filling the screen. To this scene, I add an ambient light and a point light, then map all of my cubes to a custom Cube component. Within the cube component, there is some logic to randomly increment each cube's rotation at a set interval, causing them each to rotate in their own way. Netlify I host this website on Netlify. Using this service, I can deploy my react site straight from github. To push live changes to the site, it is as simple as merging pull requests into the github repo. The rest is taken care of automatically. Things to Improve Overall, I am very happy with this website. It is so much better than the one I made in highschool, and actually makes me proud to have online. (sometimes I got nervous that people would actually see my old website). As I stated above, I am not using Next.js or Tailwind for css, but I am perfectly happy with this decision. If there is one reason I might consideer switching to Next, it would be for improved SEO optimization capabilities that come with serverside rendering. Additionally, my current method of storing all the posts within the application itself seems a bit janky to me. Ideally, I setup some sort of database that I can push the articles to and render them on the server with Next. That, though, is a project for another time.

Chat With (AI) Me Luke Schollerhaha About All Posts Projects A Calculus Parody Music Video Published March 20, 2025 Views: 381,275 Background My junior year of high school, we were assigned a final project in AP Calc AB and one of our options was to make a music video. This does seem a bit odd, doesnt it? A music video? For calculus? That is, until you realize that calculus music videos have kind of become a thing, with 2,500+ posted to youtube to date (see Ultimate Calculus Parody Song Playlist). I knew I wanted to make a parody song, so I started brainstorming. Many ideas came and went. Then, the first good line came to me: could try boxing, maybe shading, but here we are now, integrating. From that point on, I knew it would be a Nirvana parody, and Smells Like Calculus was born. Production After writing the full list of lyrics, I had to figure out how I would film the video and record the vocals. I think one of the factors that contributed to the success of this video was research. I remember watching multiple videos explaining how Kurt Cobain recorded his vocals. I remember scouring youtube and watching the best calculus parody videos over and over again to attempt to mimic their stylistic choices. To record the video I used a gopro, but in retrospect an iphone or any camera would have been fine. I think the camera is an often overthought part of calculus parody music video production quality. I filmed the video over the course of about a week, getting random clips here and there during the school day. I cut it all together in Davinci Resolve because it was free. The editing wasn't too intense and any video editing software would have been fine. For the vocals, I used FL studio because it was free. I remember screaming the vocals at the top of my lungs in my room -- the parents were probably very confused. As per my research on Kurt Cobain, I recorded many of the vocals multiple times and layerd them on top of eachother for a more full sound. Then, by a combination of reverb, EQ, compression, distortion, and other effects, I attempted to mimic the sound further.

Chat With (AI) Me Luke Schollerhaha About All Posts Projects An Exploration of PID Control Published March 17, 2025 View in Fullscreen Background The above is a simulation of a PID controller. PID control is an algorithm used in everything from drones to home heating systems, and I have been fascinated by it since I became aware of its existence. The yellow circle is the target position and directly follows the position of your mouse. The white circle implements a PID controller to track the target position in real time. I built this article after realizing during my research that there are no good explanations online that had everything I was looking for. My motivation while making this article was that it might be the article I wish I came across when I was learning PID controls. All in one place, I present an interactive demo, mathematical background, and an explanation of programmatic implementation. Introduction The letters P, I, and D stand for Proportional, Integral, and Derivative, respectively. A detailed explanation of the math is given further in this article, but I will start with some intuition. I like to think about the system as a sort of spring. In this analogy, the P term might be the stiffness of the spring and the D some damping. I know, this is not a perfect analogy, but it helped me in understanding the utility of the sliders. Do not worry about I for now. Zero out Kp, Ki, and Kd. Now increment only Kp. You will find that the white circle aggressively moves towards the target yellow circle and in fact overshoots the target. To mitigate this, increase Kd until there is less overshoot. You now are familiar with the importance of the ratio between P and D. Make P is too high and the the system overshoots. Make D too high and the response is slow. You may notice that by putting the D term to its max and the others low, the white circle very nicely tracks the position of the yellow. Why can't we just keep cranking up Kd? Well, with only Kd and nothing else, the system has no feedback based on the absolute position of the error, only the rate of change of the error. Thus, if there is any initial offset, it will persist given any change to the target position. We need Kp and Ki to correct for offsets. Furthermore, in real systems, the behavior of high Kd is often not as nice as this prestine computer simulation. Systems can enter oscillations if the D term is too high, and the data will not be clean enough that Kd alone maps the value so closely to the target. Finally, I should mention the I term. Imagine we have a real system -- a small robotic car. We want the car to steer towards a center line to follow it. Imagine we are very, very close to the center of the line and our proportional output is 0.1. A common issue that arises in real systems is that our means of moving an object does not have enough resolution to respond to very small outputs from Kp. In the case of our car, a steering servo might only have the resolution to respond at, say, intervals of 0.2. Our Kp output of 0.1 is less than this! The car would not move. The I term is the solution to this issue. I accumulates error over time. If our car is off by 0.1 for a duration of time, the I term will accumulate and correct for this small error, commonly known as steady state error. A simple explanation of PID control: P: If you aren't where you want to be, go there I: If you haven't been where you want to be for a long time, get there quicker D: if you are moving quickly towards where you want to go, slow down In the above simulation, the effects of Ki may be hard to understand. This is due to the fact that, again, a computer system is very prestine. The simulation has the ability to respond to very very low proportional output values and is not limited by any physical hardware constraints. The Math The outputs P, I, and D are given by: P r o p o r t i o n a l = e ( t ) I n t e g r a l = âˆ« e ( t ) d t D e r i v a t i v e = d e ( t ) d t where e ( t ) is the error at time t calculated by the difference between the position of the two circles With this and constants K p , K i , and K d , we can calculate the response from our PID controller as: u ( t ) = K p â‹… e ( t ) + K i â‹… âˆ« e ( t ) d t + K d â‹… d e ( t ) d t By applying this output on each frame to the velocity of the white ball, its position is controlled. I would like to make a brief aside here about the process of tuning a PID controller. By tuning, I simply mean finding the values Kp, Ki, and Kd which result in optimal performance. There are mathematically sound ways of calculating optimal values such as the Ziegler Nichols Method, however I will not being going into detail here. In my experience with PID control, which has only been racing drones, tuning is more of an art form, and optimal values are often left up to personal preference! Programmatic Implementation At this point, you may have some intuitive understanding of how a PID controller works as well as an idea of how the math behind it works. How might we actually implement such a thing though? I see calculus in the math -- how am I supposed to work with continuous data on a discrete machine?? These questions are some of the many I had when attempting to actually implement this thing in code. I found a few ok resources when I was troubleshooting, but I hope to provide a clear explanation below. I will begin with the logic for the PID simulation, then get into the details of my specific implementation The code for the PID controller itself is as follows: class PID { constructor(kp, ki, kd, setpoint) { this.kp = kp; this.ki = ki; this.kd = kd; this.setpoint = setpoint; this.integral = 0; this.derivative = 0; this.time = Date.now(); this.preverror = 0; } compute(position, setpoint) { this.setpoint = setpoint; //get dt and set previous time var dt = Date.now() - this.time; this.time = Date.now(); //calculate error var error = this.setpoint - position; //change integral value this.integral += error * dt; //cap integral value to prevent runaway if (this.integral > 5000) { this.integral = 5000; } else if (this.integral < -5000) { this.integral = -5000; } //get derivative var derivative = (error - this.preverror) / dt; //output var output = this.kp * error + this.ki * this.integral + this.kd * derivative; //store error for next derivative this.preverror = error; //return return output; } } Let's break it down into smaller sections. I create a class so that we can easily create PID objects if I ever intend to control more than one thing at once or have multiple dimensions. If I wanted to, say, move the yellow target circle around in two dimensions, I would need a PID controller for both axes. The constructor function for this class takes in an initial kp, ki, and kd, as well as a setpoint. With this, We can create our controller with: const PID1 = new PID(0.1, 0, 2, 5) Next in the class, I define the compute method, which will be called with every animation cycle. It takes the current position of the white ball as well as a setpoint, which in my case is the position of the yellow ball. A call to the function looks like: PID1.compute(circle1.ypos, mousepos) the output of this can then be added to the velocity of the white circle. Finally, I begin implementing the logic for PID control. Because we have multiple components which depend on time, we start by getting the time that has elapsed since the last call to compute(). This is done by: var dt = Date.now() - this.time; this.time = Date.now(); Date.now() is the equivalent to millis() in arduino, getting the time in milliseconds. I compare with a previously stored time to get the difference in time, dt. Next, I calculate the proportional term which is just equal to the error at the given moment: var error = this.setpoint - position; for the integral term, it would be impossible to truly sum the error infinitesimal changes in time, so instead we make our best approximation by adding (error * dt) to an accumulating variable, this.integral: this.integral += error * dt; Finally, the derivative. Again, it would be impossible to know the slope for an infinitesimal step in time, so we do our best by approximation. This is a simple rise over run calculation to find the slope, requiring the error from the previous call to compute(). var derivative = (error - this.preverror) / dt; To make this work the next time around, we set the previous time to what is now the current time: this.preverror = error; At last, we can put it all together and return our output: var output = this.kp * error + this.ki * this.integral + this.kd * derivative; Back to Top Â© 2025 Luke Scholler About All Posts Projects This Website is a Work in Progress!! Chat With (AI) Me Luke Schollerhaha About All Posts Projects I've Discovered Docker And My Life Will Never Be The Same Published February 23, 2025 My Experience If you have been around tech for a sufficient amount of time, I'm sure you have heard of Docker. In my experience, anytime I heard the word docker I became instantly scared of the topic and shifted my attention to another solution. The reality is, I never understood what docker is even trying to do! I had heard of kubernetes and docker-compose and the whole world of things yet if you asked me when/why anyone would use docker, I would have had no idea. That is, until it was exactly what I needed this semester as part of this research project I completed at my University. The Aha Moment! As part of my project, it was necessary that I find a way to efficiently and effectively deploy code to a raspberry pi 5. I was writing code locally on my laptop and simulating the Drone flight. Before I knew about docker, I kinda just hoped I would find a way. There are two main issues I faced when it actually came time to deploy the code: How was I going to ensure that all of my dependencies and processes would work as expected on different hardware? If I wanted to be able to debug in real time, how should I go about uploading new code to the Raspberry Pi? As it turns out, Docker is the perfect solution to both of these problems. The first problem is docker's bread and butter. Docker fixes the age old problem: I promise it works on my machine. I like to think about docker like a virtual machine, except instead of allowing compatibility among operating systems, docker ensures compatibility among similar hardware architectures. This means that if I build a docker image for arm64 architecture, any machine with that architecture should be able to run the image! As for the second problem, Docker's concept of an image allows the code to be easily packaged up and published on Docker Hub. Then, as if by magic, the image can be pulled from the cloud and deployed. Docker is very clever about the way it caches data, and in my experience, I was able to go from ctrl+s on my laptop to docker run on the Pi in about 5 seconds. How to Actually Use Docker To use Docker, you must understand its three common components: Dockerfiles Think of the Dockerfile as a blueprint for the virtual machine that your code will run on. The Dockerfile initializes a new machine, installing dependencies and code. Using CMD, you can specify the entry point for your application. Take the dockerfile from my Drone project as an example: FROM arm64v8/python:3.12 # Install system dependencies for building Python packages RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc g++ libpython3-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev make python3-pip python3-dev build-essential && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* WORKDIR / COPY requirements.txt . RUN pip install -r requirements.txt COPY . . CMD [python, ./Drone.py] The Dockerfile uses FROM to begin its configuration with the official python docker image which can be found on Docker hub. The, using RUN, the Dockerfile installs the system dependencies required for my environment. Next, it uses WORKDIR. This is the Dockerfile of cd and I use it to ensure I am in the root directory of the machine. I then copy requirements.txt from the directory of the dockerfile to the machine, install the python requirements by with RUN, and finally copy the rest of the directory and specify the entry point with CMD. Images Once a Dockerfile has been created, it can be used as a template to create a Docker image. This image is incredibly portable, and is where docker is really able to solve my second problem listed above. The image is everything you need to run your code on whatever machine you want. It contains within itself all of the dependencies that were specified in its Dockerfile and runs in its own private environment, so there is no need to worry about sytem environment varibale or any changes in OS configuration. How to build a Docker image Once you have successfully created a Dockerfile, build the image simply using the following: $ sudo docker build . To view your image or all of your images, run: $ sudo docker images Now we have an image! in the next section, we will run the image and create what is a container Containers A docker contianer can be though of as a running instance of your program that has been spawned using the docker image. Using the image, many containers can be spawned and deployed across many machines. A docker container can be run using the following: $ sudo docker run -it image-name where image-name is the name of the image you previously built. The -it specifies that the container will run with an interactive terminal, which may be useful for certain applications. Below are some common flags which I find helpful: -it run in interactive terminal mode -p internal:external forward a port from within the docker container to the host machine's network -restart always run the docker container if no instance is already running --device device forward any device from the host machine into the docker container My Workflow Once I have created a Dockerfile, any change I make to the code is accomplished with the following: $ sudo docker build -t 1112luke/drone . $ sudo docker push 1112luke/drone Then, on the raspberry pi, I can simply pull the image and run with: $ sudo docker pull 1112luke/drone $ sudo docker run -it --device /dev/ttyUSB0 -p 14551:14551 --restart always 1112luke/drone The entire process, from saving the code on my laptop to running it on the raspberry pi takes around 5 seconds. What's Next? Learning and using Docker has truly been a joy. In my experience, I find that any new tool I consistently use falls into one of three categories: Tools that are necessary but I don't enjoy using. -cron, stripe, windows 11, etc. Tools that are unnecessary but I enjoy using. -way too many VSCode plugins, color customizations, most other customizations, etc. Tools that are necessary and I enjoy using. -Docker, React, Unix commands, Framer motion, etc. As you can see, Docker falls right into the third category as a tool I feel is both necessary and enjoyable to use. Tools like Docker make me want to have a project where I need it. I hope I will be able to learn more about docker, specifically about Docker-Compose and Kubernetes, as I tackle more complex projects. Back to Top Â© 2025 Luke Scholler About All Posts Projects",
