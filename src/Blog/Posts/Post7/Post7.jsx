                Recently, I went for a run and I caught myself thinking in a
                very programmatic way. It was only after consideration That I
                realized two benefits of this:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Thinking in code provides an easy gateway for realizing your
                    solutions programmatically
                </li>
                <li>
                    Thinking in code provides an incredibly solid framework for
                    reasoning and logic
                </li>
            </ol>
        </>
    );
}
