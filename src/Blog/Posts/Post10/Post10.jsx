            <p>
                This widget, which you see above and can access in the bottom
                right corner of every page of my website, is an AI chatbot just
                like any other, except I have created the AI so that it responds
                as if it were me. With this being said, it is still an AI, and I
                do not have direct control over exactly what it says, so please,
                do not take anything it says as if I said it!
            </p>
